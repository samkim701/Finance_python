1. Identify Risk


Market Risk: possibility of an investory losing money due to factors 
             that affect the overall performance of financial markets.       
    Equity(Stock) 
        - Volatility
        - Stock Prices Rise & Fall
    Interest Rate RIsk 
        - Central Bank Raises/Lowers Rate
        - Trying to Manage Inflation
        - Interest Rates Rise : Slow Economy Down
                              : Current Bond Values Fall
                              : Stock Prices may Fall
        - Interest Rates Decrease : Speed Economy Up
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk
        - Gain or Loss due to currency holdings
        - Manage over exposure to certain currency markets
    Commodity RIsk
        - Rising cost of commodities passed on
        - Oil price rise, increases gas cost


Credit Risk: 
    Bankruptcy
	- Cannot pay debts
	- Write them off as loss
	- Go out of business
    Downgrade Risk
	- Deemed higher risk for lenders by a credit rating agency (S&P, Moody's)
	- Results in higher interest rates charged by lenders to the firm
    Concentration Risk
	- Too much in one type of loan
		(Prime and subprime)  


Liquidity Risk:
    Ability to meet short term obligations				
	- Current Ratio         Current Ratio: Current Assets / Current liabilities
	- Quick Ratio		Quick Ratio: (Current Assets - inventory) / Current liabilities	
				    Current Assets: Assets that company can convert into cash, sell within one year.
				    (Ex: Cash, Cash equivalents, Account receivable, Inventory, Short-term investments, prepaid expenses_
				    Inventory: Can't be converted right away but could be in 1 year so still current assets	     
    Known Risk, Unknown Risk


Interaction of Risks
	ex: Subprime Mortgage Crisis
		Credit Risk: Banks making risky sub-prime loans
			     Increased defaults
		Liquidity Risk: Cash Flow goes negative
				Banks struggle to pay bills
		Market Risk: Bank credit ratings downgraded
			     Stock price collapses

Other Risks to consider
	Operational
		- Normal business operations
		- Safety level of a factory
	Strategic
		- Business Model
		- Overall Strategy
		- Reputation

How can we respond to the financial risks
	Avoid the risk entirely
	Accept the risk
	Decrease Exposure to the risk
	Transfer risk


2. Analyze risk


Expected Loss
	Relatively simple calculation
	Can help you to pinpoint your focus
	FRM for a loan company

	- Calculate Expected Loss
		Assess Risk Factors For companies lending Operation
			Historical Data, Industry Benchmarks
	  EAD (Exposure at default): The exposure to risk(Currency Amount)
	  PD (Probability of Default): Chance the event occurs(%)
	  LGD (Loss Given the Default): Amount of loss (% 0 - 100%)
	  EL (Expected Loss) = EAD * LGD * PD

Unexpected Loss
	 Considered a variation of the expected Loss(Standard deviation of EL)
	 UL = EAD * square_root[(PD^2 * Variance of loss given default) + (LGD^2 * Variance of probability of default)] 
								Variance of loss given default = (LGD)(1 - LGD) / 4
								Variance of probability of default = (PD)(1 - PD)

VaR(Value at Risk)
     Many risk measures look at Volatility
     Advantages: VaR is applicable to all types of assets- bonds, shares, derivatives, currencies
     Disadvantages: The larger the number of assets, the more difficult it is to calculate VaR.
                    Doesn't tell beyond the confidence level(Loss could be much larger)
