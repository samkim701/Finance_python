Welcome! This repository contains my Python learning journey, with a focus on **financial engineering**, **data analysis**, and **core programming concepts**. The work here supports my goal of Financial Engineering.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Overview

### `/finance_projects/`   (Still working on it)
Quantitative finance tools and strategy prototypes:
- ðŸ“ˆ `CAGR_calculation.ipynb` â€“ Computes Compound Annual Growth Rate for investment returns.
- ðŸ“‰ `drawdown_flagging.py` â€“ Flags drawdowns greater than a threshold (e.g. 2%).
- ðŸ“Š `portfolio_return_calculator.ipynb` â€“ Calculates daily and total portfolio returns.

### `/numpy_pandas_basics/`  (done 7/13/2025)
Hands-on practice with:
- NumPy arrays, matrix operations
- Pandas DataFrames, indexing, filtering, and sorting

### `/notebooks/`   (use when needed)
Daily practice notebooks aligned with my learning plan:
- Variables, lists, control flow
- Functions, loops, and logic exercises

### `/misc/` (contains some junk stuff too)
Miscellaneous practice scripts and experiments.
